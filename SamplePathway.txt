Go through all possible 1st reactions
Go through all possible 2nd reactions (for each reactant of the 1st reactions)

.

At each stage:
If a reaction yields no reagents not already present in the pathway, prune this pathway
If a reaction yields only same reagent back, prune this pathway 

At each branch point, produce an entire new pathway 




Z (endpoint)
A, B (start points)

E+F = Z (1), C+D = Z (2)

2A = E (3), A+B = E (4), A+2B = F (5), 2A+B= = F (6)
